### Processor Scheduling

#### üñ•Ô∏è Overview  
**Processor scheduling** is a critical component of an operating system that manages the execution of processes by allocating CPU time to them. The goal of processor scheduling is to ensure optimal system performance by efficiently utilizing CPU resources. It handles processes in the ready queue, ensuring that the CPU is always executing processes in an organized manner, optimizing for fairness, responsiveness, and throughput.

### üîë Key Concepts

1. **Process States**
   - Processes can be in several states during their life cycle: **New**, **Ready**, **Running**, **Waiting**, **Terminated**.
   - The CPU is always allocated to processes in the **Ready** state, and when a process is running, it can transition to other states based on conditions (e.g., I/O requests).

2. **Ready Queue**
   - The **Ready Queue** is a queue that holds processes that are ready to execute but are waiting for CPU time.
   - Processes in this queue are waiting for the CPU to be allocated.

3. **CPU Bound vs I/O Bound**
   - **CPU-bound processes** primarily need CPU time for computation.
   - **I/O-bound processes** spend more time waiting for I/O operations (like disk access) and less time on the CPU.

4. **Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive Scheduling**
   - **Preemptive** scheduling allows the operating system to interrupt a running process and allocate CPU time to another process.
   - **Non-preemptive** scheduling means a process runs until it either completes or voluntarily gives up the CPU.

### üìä Scheduling Algorithms

#### 1. **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**

- **Description**: FCFS is the simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. It assigns CPU time to processes in the order they arrive.
- **Pros**:
  - Easy to implement and understand.
  - Fair for processes that arrive in the system at the same time.
- **Cons**:
  - Can cause long waiting times for processes if a long job arrives first (convoy effect).

| **Process** | **Arrival Time** | **Burst Time** | **Completion Time** | **Turnaround Time** | **Waiting Time** |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| P1          | 0                | 5              | 5                   | 5                   | 0                |
| P2          | 1                | 4              | 9                   | 8                   | 4                |
| P3          | 2                | 6              | 15                  | 13                  | 7                |

#### 2. **Shortest Job First (SJF)**

- **Description**: SJF schedules processes with the smallest execution time first.
- **Pros**:
  - Minimizes average waiting time.
- **Cons**:
  - Can lead to starvation for long processes (if shorter ones keep arriving).

| **Process** | **Arrival Time** | **Burst Time** | **Completion Time** | **Turnaround Time** | **Waiting Time** |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| P1          | 0                | 5              | 5                   | 5                   | 0                |
| P2          | 1                | 4              | 9                   | 8                   | 4                |
| P3          | 2                | 6              | 15                  | 13                  | 7                |

#### 3. **Round Robin (RR)**

- **Description**: In Round Robin scheduling, each process gets a fixed time slice or quantum. Once a process's time slice expires, it's preempted and the next process is given the CPU.
- **Pros**:
  - Fair and provides a good response time for interactive systems.
  - Simple and widely used in time-sharing systems.
- **Cons**:
  - Can have high turnaround time for long processes if the time quantum is too short.

| **Process** | **Arrival Time** | **Burst Time** | **Time Quantum** | **Completion Time** | **Turnaround Time** | **Waiting Time** |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| P1          | 0                | 5              | 3                 | 15                  | 15                  | 10               |
| P2          | 1                | 4              | 3                 | 14                  | 13                  | 9                |
| P3          | 2                | 6              | 3                 | 18                  | 16                  | 10               |

#### 4. **Priority Scheduling**

- **Description**: Each process is assigned a priority. The process with the highest priority is given the CPU first. This can be either preemptive or non-preemptive.
- **Pros**:
  - Suitable for systems where processes have varying levels of importance.
  - Can improve system responsiveness for high-priority tasks.
- **Cons**:
  - Low-priority processes can starve if high-priority processes continue to arrive.

| **Process** | **Priority** | **Burst Time** | **Completion Time** | **Turnaround Time** | **Waiting Time** |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| P1          | 1            | 5              | 5                   | 5                   | 0                |
| P2          | 2            | 4              | 9                   | 8                   | 4                |
| P3          | 3            | 6              | 15                  | 13                  | 7                |

#### 5. **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**

- **Description**: In multilevel queue scheduling, processes are divided into multiple queues based on their priority or type (e.g., interactive vs batch). Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm.
- **Pros**:
  - Efficient for systems with diverse types of processes.
  - Allows for different algorithms to be applied to different process types.
- **Cons**:
  - Complex to implement and manage.
  - May lead to starvation in lower-priority queues.

| **Queue**  | **Process** | **Priority** | **Burst Time** |
|------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| High       | P1          | 1            | 5              |
| High       | P2          | 2            | 4              |
| Low        | P3          | 3            | 6              |

### üßë‚Äçüíª Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive Scheduling

| **Scheduling Type**  | **Description**                                                                 | **Advantages**                                                             | **Disadvantages**                                                            |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Preemptive**        | The OS can interrupt a running process and assign CPU time to another process.  | - Ensures fair CPU allocation.<br> - Improves system responsiveness.        | - Can cause more overhead due to frequent context switches.                   |
| **Non-Preemptive**    | A process runs until it voluntarily gives up the CPU or completes.              | - Less context switching.<br> - Simpler to implement.                       | - May cause poor system responsiveness, especially for interactive systems.   |

### üîÑ Scheduling Criteria

To evaluate the effectiveness of CPU scheduling algorithms, several criteria are considered:

1. **CPU Utilization**  
   The goal is to maximize CPU utilization by keeping the CPU busy as much as possible.

2. **Throughput**  
   Throughput refers to the number of processes completed within a given time frame.

3. **Turnaround Time**  
   Turnaround time is the total time taken for a process to complete, from arrival to termination.

4. **Waiting Time**  
   Waiting time is the amount of time a process spends waiting in the ready queue before being executed.

5. **Response Time**  
   Response time is the time between submitting a request and receiving the first response. This is especially important in interactive systems.

### ‚ú® Summary

Processor scheduling is a crucial function of an operating system that allocates CPU time to processes, ensuring that the CPU is used efficiently. Various scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling aim to balance fairness, response time, and throughput. Preemptive scheduling allows for better responsiveness, while non-preemptive scheduling reduces context switching overhead. Proper processor scheduling ensures optimal performance in systems with multiple processes competing for CPU resources.
