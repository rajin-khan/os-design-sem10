### Interrupts and Context Switching  

#### üñ•Ô∏è Overview  
In operating systems, **interrupts** and **context switching** are essential for managing multi-tasking and process execution. Interrupts enable the CPU to respond to critical events in real-time, while context switching allows the operating system to pause one process and resume another. These mechanisms work together to ensure that resources are used efficiently and that multiple processes can run concurrently.

### üîë Key Concepts  

1. **Interrupts**  
   An **interrupt** is a mechanism that temporarily halts the current execution of a program to give attention to a high-priority event or process. Interrupts are essential for **handling external events** like user input, hardware errors, or time slices in multitasking.

2. **Context Switching**  
   **Context switching** refers to the process of saving the state of a currently running process and loading the state of the next process to be executed. This allows the operating system to switch between processes efficiently and gives the illusion of parallel execution on a single CPU.

### üîÑ Process of Interrupts  

1. **Interrupt Trigger**  
   Interrupts can be triggered by various events, such as:
   - **Hardware interrupts**: These include hardware signals like timer interrupts, I/O completion, or system errors.
   - **Software interrupts**: These are caused by the program itself, like system calls or exceptions.

2. **Interrupt Handling**  
   When an interrupt occurs, the CPU performs the following steps:
   - **Suspends the current execution**: The CPU pauses the process that is currently running.
   - **Saves the state of the process**: The CPU stores the process's state, such as the program counter and register values.
   - **Transfers control to the interrupt handler**: The interrupt handler is a special piece of code designed to handle the interrupt. It processes the interrupt and decides how to handle it.

3. **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**  
   The **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)** is the code that runs when an interrupt occurs. The ISR is responsible for handling the interrupt and may involve:
   - Processing input or output
   - Handling errors or exceptions
   - Preempting the running process if necessary.

4. **Resuming the Process**  
   After the ISR finishes, the operating system restores the previously saved state of the interrupted process, and execution resumes from where it was paused.

### üß† Context Switching  

Context switching is an essential part of multitasking in an operating system. When a process is interrupted or the time slice ends, a **context switch** occurs.

1. **Definition of Context Switch**  
   A **context switch** refers to the process of saving the state of the current process and loading the state of the next process. The key elements involved in context switching include:
   - **Program counter**: The location in memory of the next instruction to execute.
   - **CPU registers**: The values stored in the CPU during execution.
   - **Process Control Block (PCB)**: Contains the state information (program counter, CPU registers, etc.) of each process.

2. **Steps of a Context Switch**  
   - **Save the context of the current process**: The operating system saves the process's program counter and other register values into the PCB.
   - **Select the next process**: The scheduler selects the next process to run based on the scheduling algorithm (e.g., Round Robin, First Come First Serve).
   - **Load the context of the next process**: The process's state is restored from its PCB, including the program counter and registers.
   - **Resume execution**: The new process starts executing from the point where it was previously paused.

3. **Time Overhead**  
   Context switching incurs some overhead, as it involves saving and loading the process state. Frequent context switches can affect performance, especially in systems with many processes.

### üèóÔ∏è Key Differences: Interrupt vs. Context Switch  

| **Aspect**                | **Interrupt**                                                        | **Context Switch**                                                     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**             | Temporarily halts the CPU's current execution to handle an event.   | Switches the CPU from one process to another by saving and loading states. |
| **Trigger**                | Caused by external or internal events (e.g., I/O, timer).           | Triggered by scheduling algorithms or interrupts.                     |
| **Focus**                  | Handling high-priority tasks (like I/O operations, hardware faults).| Switching between processes for multitasking.                         |
| **Scope**                  | Affects only the current process's execution flow.                  | Involves saving and restoring the execution state of processes.       |
| **Overhead**               | Minimal, focused on responding to events.                           | Higher, due to saving and restoring the full process state.           |

### üßë‚Äçüíª Real-World Example: Time-Slice Scheduling  

In **time-slice scheduling**, the CPU allocates a fixed time slice (quantum) to each process. When a process's time slice expires, a context switch occurs to switch to the next process in the queue. If an interrupt occurs (such as an I/O operation completing), it may also trigger a context switch.

```c
// Example of Time Slice Scheduling
void scheduler() {
    while (true) {
        // Select process to run based on scheduling algorithm (e.g., Round Robin)
        Process current = select_next_process();
        
        // Save the context of the current process
        save_context(current);
        
        // Load the context of the next process
        load_context(next_process);
        
        // Execute the process
        run_process(next_process);
    }
}
```

- **Explanation**:  
  - The **scheduler** selects the next process to run based on the scheduling algorithm.
  - It then **saves** the context (program counter, registers) of the currently running process and **loads** the context of the next process.
  - The process is executed until its time slice expires or an interrupt occurs.
