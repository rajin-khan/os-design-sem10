### Process State Transition  

#### üñ•Ô∏è Overview  
The **Process State Transition** describes the various states that a process goes through during its lifetime in an operating system. Understanding these states is crucial for process management and scheduling. A process may transition between different states based on external events, like user input or system interrupts.

### üîë Key Concepts  

1. **Definition of Process States**  
   A **process** is an instance of a program in execution. Its state is tracked by the operating system to manage its execution. The process moves between various states based on its activities and events that occur during its execution.

2. **Life Cycle of a Process**  
   The life cycle of a process involves multiple states, such as **new**, **ready**, **running**, **waiting**, and **terminated**. These states represent the various phases a process goes through from creation to completion.

| **State**           | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **New**             | The process is being created but has not yet started execution.                |
| **Ready**           | The process is in memory, waiting for CPU time to start execution.             |
| **Running**         | The process is currently being executed by the CPU.                           |
| **Waiting (Blocked)**| The process is waiting for an external event (e.g., I/O completion).          |
| **Terminated (Exit)**| The process has completed its execution or has been killed.                   |

### üîÑ Process State Transitions  

1. **New ‚Üí Ready**  
   After the process is created (typically in the New state), it is moved to the **Ready** state once it is loaded into memory and prepared for execution.  

2. **Ready ‚Üí Running**  
   The process is assigned to the CPU and begins execution. It remains in this state until it either finishes its task or requires I/O operations.  

3. **Running ‚Üí Waiting (Blocked)**  
   If the process needs to wait for an event (e.g., I/O completion), it transitions to the **Waiting** state. The process relinquishes the CPU during this period.  

4. **Waiting (Blocked) ‚Üí Ready**  
   Once the event the process was waiting for is completed (e.g., I/O operation), the process transitions back to the **Ready** state, awaiting its turn on the CPU.  

5. **Running ‚Üí Terminated (Exit)**  
   Once a process completes its execution or is terminated by the operating system, it moves to the **Terminated** state.  

6. **Ready ‚Üí Terminated**  
   In certain cases, a process may be terminated before it gets a chance to run.

### üß† Detailed Process State Transitions  

#### 1. **Ready State**  
   - Processes in the Ready state are in the **Ready Queue**.
   - They are waiting for the CPU, but no I/O or other operations are pending.
   - The scheduler selects one process from the Ready Queue to allocate CPU time.
   
#### 2. **Running State**  
   - When a process is selected by the scheduler, it moves to the Running state.
   - The **Process Control Block (PCB)** holds information about the process such as the state, program counter, registers, memory management data, etc.
   - The process runs until it either completes, waits for I/O, or is preempted by another process.

#### 3. **Waiting (Blocked) State**  
   - A process in the Waiting state cannot continue until some event or condition is met, like the completion of I/O or the availability of a resource.
   - For example, if a process requires reading from a disk, it waits until the disk operation is complete.
   
#### 4. **Terminated (Exit) State**  
   - When the process finishes executing, or is killed, it enters the **Terminated state**.
   - The operating system then reclaims the resources allocated to the process, such as memory and open file handles.

### üõ†Ô∏è Process Control Block (PCB)  

The **Process Control Block (PCB)** is crucial for managing the state transitions of a process. It stores the process's information and allows the operating system to manage the transition between states efficiently.

| **PCB Field**        | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Process State**     | The current state of the process (new, ready, running, waiting, terminated).   |
| **Program Counter**   | The address of the next instruction to execute.                                |
| **CPU Registers**     | The values of CPU registers during process execution.                         |
| **Memory Management** | Information on memory allocated to the process (e.g., base, limit registers).  |
| **I/O Information**   | Information about the devices the process is interacting with.                |
| **Process ID**        | A unique identifier for the process.                                          |

### üßë‚Äçüíª Real-World Example: Process Scheduling  

Consider the **Round Robin Scheduling** algorithm:  

1. **Ready Queue**: Processes in the Ready state are placed in a circular queue.  
2. **Running**: Each process is given a time slice to run.  
3. **Time Expiry**: If a process‚Äôs time slice expires and it‚Äôs still not finished, it‚Äôs moved back to the Ready Queue.  
4. **Waiting**: If a process needs I/O, it transitions to Waiting, and when the I/O completes, it‚Äôs placed back in the Ready Queue.

### ‚ú® Summary  

Process State Transitions are vital for understanding how the operating system schedules and manages processes. Processes move through various states (Ready, Running, Waiting, and Terminated) based on events like I/O operations or CPU availability. The Process Control Block plays an essential role in tracking and managing these transitions.
